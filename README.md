# Fire-Alarm-System-Project-
Introduction to Computer Embedded Software and Applications

Introduction
This project demonstrates a fire alarm system simulated using TinkerCad. It uses a temperature sensor (LM35) and a gas sensor (MQ series) interfaced with Arduino UNO to detect fire conditions and trigger alerts through a buzzer and LED.

Hardware & Software Used
Arduino UNO- LM35 Temperature Sensor- Gas Sensor- LED & Buzzer- I2C LCD Display- TinkerCad Simulator

System Operation
The sensors detect anomalies in temperature and gas concentration. If thresholds are exceeded, the Arduino activates the buzzer and blinking LED. The LCD shows 'FIRE!' along with sensor readings. Otherwise, normal readings are displayed.


Conclusions
The project successfully simulates a real-time fire alarm system. All predefined targets such as sensor response, visual/audible alerts, and data display on Serial Monitor and LCD were achieved.

Discussion
Further development may include integrating internet-based alerts (IoT), adding smoke/flame sensors, and building a mobile app
